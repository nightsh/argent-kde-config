  <summary>Simple scriplet which makes a definable list of windows block the compositor when they move into fullscreen mode (predefined are videoplayer, but it can be extended with games, sw. like celestia or stellarium ;-)&#xd;
&#xd;
The script does not have a config GUI - i\'m not even sure that\'s supported atm. but after installation you can edit the list in ~/.kde/share/apps/kwin/scripts/gamemode/contents/code/main.js&#xd;
&#xd;
(afaik atm. you\'ll have to restart \&amp;quot;kwin --replace &amp;amp;\&amp;quot; to effectively update the script)</summary>

  <summary>Let snapped window edges stick together when one window is resized.&#xd;
&#xd;
The script registers two global shortcuts: one for enabling/disabling the script permanently, and one for enabling/disabling the script only for the next resize. The default shortcut keys are Meta+Shift+S and Ctrl+Shift+S, respectively. You can change them using systemsettings (or kcmshell4 keys); they are associated with the component âKWinâ. Their names are prefixed by âKWin Script: Sticky Window Snappingâ.&#xd;
&#xd;
Known issues:&#xd;
[li]There is no optical feedback when a shortcut is pressed. I do not know how to initiate a KNotify notification from a KWin script. There is the function callDBus, but I do not if or how it can be used for that purpose. KNotify provides the method âeventâ by dbus, but it expects arguments of types for which I do not know how to produce values with Java Script.[/li]&#xd;
[li]Currently, not only snapped window edges are considered as connected, but even edges which are only on the same row/column are considered as connected. I have not decided, if this is a bug or a feature, yet.[/li]</summary>
