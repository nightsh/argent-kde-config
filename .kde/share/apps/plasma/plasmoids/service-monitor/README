To install Service Monitor, run

  plasmapkg -i /path/to/service-monitor

then add the widget in KDE. If you want to remove it again, run

  plasmapkg -r service-monitor

For development, you can also use plasmoidviewer to quickly start the widget from
command line. This way you don't have to install/uninstall all the time.
