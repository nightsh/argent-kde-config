This is a very simple plasmoid to keep track of your time.

Once you add some tasks, click on one to start timing. Red tasks are paused, green task is being timed.

You can also reset, rename and delete tasks.

Time is measured in hours:minutes:seconds

The layout of the tasks can be changed to horizontal to let it fit in the controllbar of KDE.

Enjoy!
