0. Overview

Kosmoid is a simple python applet based on KopetePlasma by Giancarlo Fringuello, 
which shows your kopete contacts and can start a conversation by clicking on a contact.

This is my first plasmoid attempt, so bugs might occur :)


1. How it works

The contacts are retrieved by the dbus interface to kopete, so kopete must be running.
If kopete is not running or offline, there will be no contact list.


2. Dependencies

- kde4.*
- python (used v 2.5) 
- python bindings for dbus
- python bindings for qt4/kde4


3. How to install/uninstall

- To install you simply need to type:

	plasmapkg -i Kosmoid_[version].zip

- To uninstall:

	plasmapkg -r Kosmoid

- If you modify this plasmoid, to have an installable package you have to do:

	zip -r ../Kosmoid.zip .  (into the main directory)
