# Argent KDE config (for 4.11+)

This configuration is ripped off from my work machine, and its portability is 
fully untested and I don't know if I managed to grab all the needed files.

I'll run some VM tests and I'll update it whenever I find missing bits.

This is mainly meant to replicate my own config as a starting base for Argent.


# How can you help?

Of course, by testing it in a sterile KDE 4.11 installation. If it works and 
looks like the screenshot, it's ok:
